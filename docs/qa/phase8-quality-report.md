# Phase 8 Quality & Telemetry Summary

## Automated Coverage
- ✅ Unit: `PlanDrawer`, `DeadlineWizard`, `VoiceBar`
- ✅ Integration: SSE chat stream parser (`consumeEventStream`)
- ✅ Provider: Telemetry dashboard aggregation
- ✅ Cypress smoke specs scaffolded for chat, drafting, deadlines, and citations flows

## Accessibility & Localization
- Added top-level language switcher (FR/EN/RW) with locale persistence and WCAG-compliant focus styles.
- Verified keyboard traversal for AppShell controls, plan drawer, deadline wizard, and VoiceBar (all focus-visible with outlined states).
- Ensured reduced-motion and reduced-data settings propagate to Three.js scene fallback.

## Telemetry & Observability
- Client emits instrumentation events for citations accuracy, temporal validity, retrieval recall, HITL latency, and voice latency.
- `TelemetryDashboardProvider` aggregates metrics for dashboards and listens to Web Vitals dispatches.
- Offline voice retries and HITL actions now publish latency samples to metrics bus.

## Performance Snapshot
- Web Vitals hook (`reportWebVitals`) forwards LCP/INP/CLS measurements to telemetry bus.
- VoiceBar and LiquidBackground respect data saver + reduced motion, cutting particle animation when required.

## Outstanding Follow-ups
- Connect Cypress smoke specs to CI execution once environments can build the Next.js app.
- Integrate telemetry dashboard outputs with admin analytics surface in a future phase.
